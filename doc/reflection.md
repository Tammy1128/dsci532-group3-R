# Reflection

## Milestone 3 Implementation

The objective of this weekâ€™s milestone was to recreate and improve upon the dashboard from [Milestone 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci532-group3) using R instead of Python. Generally speaking, the [Final Dashboard](https://covid-19-mds-532-group3-r.herokuapp.com/) largely resembles the main features and functionality seen in the last iteration. There is an assortment of radio buttons and dropdowns that allow the user to specify the time period, part of the world and metrics they are interested in. The outputs of the dashboard include three interactive plots, as well as a heatmap of the world. 

Since this dashboard was an iteration of a previous version, less time was spent on conceptualizing the layout, data cleaning and the overall logic of the code. The syntactic similarities between how Dash is implemented in Python vs R meant that there was a relatively small learning curve in transitioning to R. For this particular dashboard, there were no features or functionality limitations from using R instead of Python. Interestingly, some of the issues present in the Python version of this dashboard (such as dropdown menus not automatically expanding as more contents are added) were automatically addressed in the R implementation. 

The secondary focus on this milestone was to improve upon the feedback that was provided. Some of the changes that were implemented include:

- Showing per capita data in millions so that scale is easier to understand
- Automatic resizing of dropdown list
- More points

## Future Improvements & Additions

Some of the recommendations that could not be implemented include:
- Add something
- More points
